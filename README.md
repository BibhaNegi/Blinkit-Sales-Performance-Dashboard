# Blinkit-Sales-Performance-Dashboard

Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance, customer satisfaction, and outlet trends of Blinkit. Monitored KPI's, including total sales ($1.20M), average sales per transaction ($140.99), and average customer ratings (3.92). Identified that Tier 3 outlets drove the highest sales ($472.13K), with fruits and snacks as top-selling categories ($0.18M each).

Performed a detailed analysis of customer preferences, focusing on product fat content, revealing that regular-fat items generated higher revenue ($776.7K) compared to low-fat alternatives. Assessed outlet performance by size, showing large outlets contributed the most sales ($507.90K). Identified sales trends from 2012 to 2022, highlighting a peak in 2018 ($205K).

My project demonstrates strong analytical skills in data visualization, KPI tracking, and deriving actionable business insights to support decision-making.
